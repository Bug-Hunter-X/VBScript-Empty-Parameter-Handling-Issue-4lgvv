This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to the improper handling of empty parameters passed to functions. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, where the function does not explicitly check for and handle empty parameters correctly, resulting in unexpected outputs. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version, illustrating the best practices for dealing with missing or empty parameters in VBScript functions, ensuring robust and predictable behavior.
